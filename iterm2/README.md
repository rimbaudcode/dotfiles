* download and install themes
* load the preferences from github repo:
"If you have a look at Preferences -> General you will notice at the bottom of the panel, there is a setting Load preferences from a custom folder or URL: There is a button next to it Save settings to Folder.

So all you need to do is save your settings first and load it after you reinstalled your OS."
